# Django Project Installation Guide

## Getting Started with the Project

Follow these instructions to set up and run your Django project locally.

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
3. Run the following command, replacing `<repository_url>` with the URL of this Django project:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   
## Installing Dependencies
1. Navigate to the cloned project directory:
   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   
2. Install the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setting up the Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
1. Create a virtual environment (replace myenv with your desired virtual environment name):
   ```sh
   python -m venv myenv

2. Activate the virtual environment:
On Linux/Mac:
source myenv/bin/activate

3. On Windows:
4. ```sh
   myenv\Scripts\activate

## Setting up the Database
# Check the project's settings.py file to see which database is being used (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).
If necessary, create the database and update the settings.py file with the correct database credentials.
Running Migrations
Create the database tables:
python manage.py makemigrations


Apply the migrations:
_python manage.py migrate_


## Running the Development Server
Start the development server:
```sh
python manage.py runserver


Note
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably the same version used in the project).
Make sure pip is installed and up-to-date.
Ensure the required dependencies are installed (listed in requirements.txt).
Set up a compatible database if necessary.
If you encounter any issues or errors during these steps, please don't hesitate to ask for help!
